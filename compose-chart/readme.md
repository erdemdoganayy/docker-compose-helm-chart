# Hello to all of you!

I created a docker-compose helm chart.

When you choose to utilize a docker compose template, you can use this chart and continue working on this project.

The project contains a few instances of values.yaml

## Use: 
- Save this repository to your `local folder` after downloading it.
- Revise your `chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files.
- The command `helm template . -f <your-values-yaml>` is what you should execute.
- This command ought to be executed: You may extract your results by running the following command: `helm template . -f values.yaml > output.yaml`.
